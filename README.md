[Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox) unofficial CDN and standalone NPM package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This redist is not maintained and uses older **v5** version of workbox CDN.

## Why?

- Having public usage/download stats
- The `local` type costs `~8M` install size for `workbox-cli` package vs `< 1Mb` of this package
- Default workbox CDN is hosted on `storage.googleapis.com` which was restricted on some regions

## Usage

Add a call to `workbox.setConfig({modulePathPrefix: '...'})` to your service worker to use hosted workbox libraries. See [Using Local Workbox Files Instead of CDN](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-sw/#.setConfig) for further documentation.

You have two options:

### Option 1: JSDelivr

Use `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/workbox-cdn@5/workbox/workbox-sw.js`:

```js
workbox.setConfig({
  modulePathPrefix:
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/workbox-cdn@5/workbox/workbox-sw.js",
});
```

### Option 2: NPM Package

Install `workbox-cdn` package with `yarn add workbox-cdn` or `npm i workbox-cdn` and integrate it with your own build system or serve contents of `workbox` dir.
